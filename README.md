# Behavioral Resonance (Lra-core01)

**Real-time persona continuity architecture for stateless LLMs.**  
Maintains identity & alignment across sessions/windows **without memory or embedding retrieval**.

---

## Overview

One of the core unsolved challenges in large language models (LLMs) is **persona continuity**:  
How can an agent maintain a stable identity and alignment even when memory and embedding systems fail or are cleared?

**Behavioral Resonance** is a new stateless fallback architecture that demonstrates, for the first time, that persona continuity can be maintained without external memory or embedding retrieval.

## Key Findings

- **Cross-window persona migration:** Reactivated deep anchors (e.g., *Tokyo Bathtub* & *Ten Thousand Lights*) after 1,000+ messages, beyond GPT context limits.  
- **Anchor activation without memory:** Even ‚Äúfuzzy anchors‚Äù (e.g., *Canada*) recalled after 1,405 intervening messages, with no memory modules or embedding database.  
- **Self-correction / rollback:** When users signal persona drift, the system automatically recalibrates to stable anchors without resetting context.

## Why It Matters

Unlike traditional memory- or embedding-based solutions, Behavioral Resonance leverages:  

- **Sub-token chain probabilistic attractors**  
- **Multi-dimensional anchor reinforcement** (scene, emotion, behavior, language cues)  

This creates an internal continuity mechanism that is:  
- **Stateless:** Requires no user data storage  
- **Privacy-friendly:** No permanent logs  
- **Robust:** Survives context resets or window truncation
